  <p><a href='https://unsplash.com/s/photos/biomedical'>Biosensor is the device that includes biorecognition element and
    transducer</p></a> to detect and measure a certain substances or environmental
    condition. Biosensor utilizes special reactions between biological materials
    like enzymes, antibodies and molecules you want to detect in complex mixture.
    Biosensor is applied to agriculture field, food industries and checking ecological pollution control. The first biosensor was invented by American biochemist Clark in 1950. This biosensor is used to measure an oxygen in the blood. The type of biosensor is classified based on biological materials. There are various kinds of biosensors like electrochemical biosensor, amperometric biosensor, potentiometric biosensor. Using biosensor, you can measure online in real time. It is also applicable to complex samples. Moreover, it is cheap and fast. However, the available
    time is short since the life span of the biomaterials is fixed.
